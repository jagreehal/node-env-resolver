# node-env-resolver-vite

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 3147202: ## Updated API Documentation

  ### üìö README.md Overhaul
  - **Removed migration guide** - No users yet, so removed v1 to v2 migration section
  - **Updated all code examples** - Converted from tuple-based to object-based API syntax
  - **Fixed package references** - Removed non-existent packages (`node-env-resolver-integrations`, `gcpSecrets`, `vaultSecrets`)
  - **Added CLI documentation** - Properly documented the existing CLI functionality
  - **Restored TTL caching docs** - Added comprehensive caching documentation with examples

  ### üîß API Examples Updated
  - All `resolveAsync()` calls now use `{ resolvers: [...], options: {...} }` syntax
  - All `resolve()` calls with custom resolvers use object-based config
  - Fixed AWS package examples to use correct exports (`awsSecrets`, `awsSsm`)
  - Updated framework examples (Express, Next.js, AWS Lambda)
  - Corrected security policies and audit logging examples

  ### ‚úÖ Fact-Checked Content
  - Verified all package imports point to existing packages
  - Confirmed all function signatures match current implementation
  - Validated all resolver exports are correct
  - Ensured all examples are runnable with current codebase

  ### üöÄ New Features Documented
  - **CLI argument parsing** - `import { cliArgs } from 'node-env-resolver/cli'`
  - **TTL caching** - `import { cached, TTL } from 'node-env-resolver/utils'`
  - **Advanced caching options** - Stale-while-revalidate, error resilience
  - **Cache monitoring** - Audit logs with cache metadata

  All documentation is now factually accurate and all examples should work with the current codebase.

- Updated dependencies [3147202]
  - node-env-resolver@5.0.1

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c119292: ## üöÄ Major Release: Generic Type System & Bundle Optimization

  ### ‚ú® New Features

  #### **Unlimited Resolver Tuples Support**
  - **BREAKING**: New generic type system supports unlimited resolver tuples in `resolveAsync()`, `resolve()`, and safe variants
  - No more fixed limits of 3-4 resolvers - use as many as needed!
  - Improved type inference with proper schema merging from multiple resolvers

  #### **New Vite Integration Package**
  - **NEW**: `node-env-resolver-vite` package for seamless Vite integration
  - Vite plugin for environment variable validation during build
  - Type-safe environment variables in Vite applications

  ### üîß Improvements

  #### **Bundle Size Optimization**
  - **51% smaller main bundle**: Reduced from 32KB to 15.60KB
  - **45% smaller gzipped**: Reduced from 7.80KB to 4.31KB
  - Moved `processEnv` into main index to avoid importing heavy resolvers
  - Inlined `validateFile` function to prevent pulling in entire validators module
  - Perfect for Cloudflare Workers (only 1.5% of 1MB limit)

  #### **API Enhancements**
  - **BREAKING**: Improved tuple handling with better argument parsing
  - Enhanced error messages for better developer experience
  - Fixed type inference issues across all resolver combinations
  - Improved TypeScript support with better type safety

  #### **Developer Experience**
  - Updated all examples with correct import statements and syntax
  - Fixed validator syntax (e.g., `'url?'` ‚Üí `url({optional: true})`)
  - Enhanced README documentation with comprehensive examples
  - Improved error messages and debugging information

  ### üêõ Bug Fixes
  - Fixed import path issues in test files (`validators` ‚Üí `resolvers`)
  - Resolved TypeScript compilation errors in examples
  - Fixed missing exports and type conversion issues
  - Corrected validator syntax throughout codebase

  ### üì¶ Package Updates
  - Updated AWS SDK dependencies to version 3.910.0
  - Enhanced ESLint configuration for better TypeScript support
  - Improved build configuration and bundle optimization

  ### üéØ Performance
  - **Tailwind CSS approach**: Utility-first, tree-shakeable, minimal bundle impact
  - Lazy loading architecture preserved - heavy resolvers only loaded when imported
  - Optimized for serverless environments with fast cold starts
  - 35% smaller than dotenv alternative

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c119292]
  - node-env-resolver@5.0.0
